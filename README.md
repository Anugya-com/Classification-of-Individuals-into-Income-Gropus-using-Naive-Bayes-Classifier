Given a series of data on an individual's employment, educational and demographic background how would would segmetn into different income groups for better targetting? Tried to understand is based on the dataset avaialable does an individual's income has any relation to their gender using appropriate hypothesis testing.

Model: Built a Classification Model to classify individuals into Income category of >=50000 or <50000 depending on several attributes including age,gender,country,education,workclass etc.

Business Use Case: This simple model can be used by the business to segment customers into two different income groups with partial demographic,educaitional and employment data available.

Dataset Discovery: The dataset is open-source, and it is available to the public on the website UCI Machine Learning Repository.Original owners of database:US Census Bureau.

EDA And Pre-processing: Used onehot encoding to transform categorical variables to ensure better model performance.

Model Building: Built a Naive Baye's Classifier and pre-prosesses the dataset to improve accuracy of prediction.
Model Evaluation: Evaluated based on accuracy of the different models created.

Also, conducted a Hypotheis Testing: Used Chi-Square test of independence to prove Hypothesis: There is a significant association between variables income and gender.Individual's ability to earn higher income is related to their gender.
